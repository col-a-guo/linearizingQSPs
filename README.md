Code for thesis: Linearizing Quadratic Stochastic Processes for Metagame Mixing

In the thesis, we examine the possibility of converting quadratic stochastic processes to their linear equivalent in Markov chains. This repository contains both the core advancement process, (ratioRun) and one example (a rock-paper-scissors tournament with modified win chances, RPSrun). Additionally we have a tool for analyzing a possible source for error (tvdBumps).
